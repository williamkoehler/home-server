# WebSocket Api

The websocket api is the main api used to communicate with the server. It allows fast response time and live change.

## Connection

The connection is estabilished using the `\ws` url. 
Additionally a `Autorization` header field must be passed to authenticate, either with a simple Basic Auth or a Bearer token. The bearer can be generated using the HTTP Api.

## Request

Every request must contain a two important fields:
- `msgid`: A number with will be sent in the response (allows for multiple request to be sent at the same time)
- `msg`: A string which tells the server which method to used to process the request

## Response

Every response (to a request) allways contain the following fields:
- `msgid`: The same message id used in the request
- `log`: A list of strings containing logs
- `error`: The error code that resultet from the method (0 = no error)
